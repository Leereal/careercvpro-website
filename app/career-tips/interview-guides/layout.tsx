Keep it professional, relevant to the job, and under 2 minutes. Example: 'I'm currently a Marketing Coordinator with 3 years experience in digital marketing.

Arriving more than 20 minutes early can inconvenience the interviewer, while arriving late (even by 5 minutes) makes a poor first impression.",

When asked, give a range rather than a fixed number: 'Based on my research and experience, I'm looking at R25,000 to R30,000 per month.' Add that you're open to discussion based on the full package. Try to let them mention salary first, and never accept an offer on the spot - ask for time to consider it.",

Good questions include: 'What does success look like in this role in the first 90 days?', 'How would you describe the team culture?', 'What opportunities for growth and development are available?', 'What are the biggest challenges facing the team right now?'. Avoid asking about salary, leave, or benefits in the first interview.",

Dress professionally from head to toe (in case you need to stand). Look at the camera (not the screen) to make eye contact. Have a backup plan (phone number) in case of tech issues.

Keep it brief: thank them for their time, reiterate your interest in the role, briefly mention something specific from the conversation, and offer to provide any additional information. This simple gesture sets you apart from other candidates and keeps you fresh in their minds.",

For longer gaps, focus on productive activities: further studies, freelance work, volunteering, caring for family, or skill development. Frame it positively: 'I took time to complete my project management certification' or 'I cared for a family member while doing freelance consulting'.
